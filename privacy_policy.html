    <h1>Privacy Policy - Firebase Storage Access API</h1>
    <p><em>Last Updated: May 19, 2025</em></p>
    
    <div class="section">
        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>This Privacy Policy applies to the Firebase Storage Access API ("the API") that provides access to files stored in Firebase Storage for authorized users. The API is designed to be used with OpenAI's GPT platform to enable secure access to EEG datasets and related files.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="section">
        <h2>2. Data Collection and Usage</h2>
        <p>The API only accesses files that are stored in your own Firebase Storage bucket. It does not collect, store, or process any personal data beyond what is necessary to authenticate and fulfill file access requests.</p>
        
        <h3>2.1 Information Collected</h3>
        <p>The API collects the following information:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>API request metadata (timestamp, requested file paths, IP address)</li>
            <li>Authentication information for verifying access rights</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>2.2 Purpose of Collection</h3>
        <p>This information is collected solely for:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Authenticating users and authorizing access to files</li>
            <li>Providing the requested file information or content</li>
            <li>Maintaining audit logs for security purposes</li>
            <li>Improving the API functionality</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    
    <div class="section">
        <h2>3. Data Access and Control</h2>
        <p>The API follows the principle of least privilege and only accesses files that are explicitly requested by authorized users. All file access is subject to Firebase Storage security rules and authentication mechanisms.</p>
        
        <p>You maintain full control over:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Which files are stored in your Firebase Storage bucket</li>
            <li>Who can access the API</li>
            <li>What operations can be performed on your files</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    
    <div class="section">
        <h2>4. Data Sharing</h2>
        <p>The API does not share any data with third parties except as necessary to fulfill its core functionality (i.e., retrieving files from Firebase Storage). File content is only shared with the authenticated requestor.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="section">
        <h2>5. Security Measures</h2>
        <p>The API implements the following security measures:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Authentication using secure tokens</li>
            <li>HTTPS encryption for all data in transit</li>
            <li>Access logging for audit purposes</li>
            <li>Adherence to Firebase security best practices</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    
    <div class="section">
        <h2>6. Data Retention</h2>
        <p>API access logs are retained for a maximum of 30 days for security and troubleshooting purposes. The API does not permanently store any file content - it only retrieves and serves files from your Firebase Storage bucket.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="section">
        <h2>7. Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>This privacy policy may be updated from time to time to reflect changes in the API functionality or applicable regulations. Any significant changes will be communicated to API users.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="section">
        <h2>8. Contact Information</h2>
        <p>If you have any questions about this privacy policy or the API's data practices, please contact:</p>
